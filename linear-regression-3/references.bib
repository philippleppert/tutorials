 abstract = {The effects on the distribution of least-squares residuals of a series of model mis-specifications are considered. It is shown that for a variety of specification errors the distributions of the least-squares residuals are normal, but with non-zero means. An alternative predictor of the disturbance vector is used in developing four procedures for testing for the presence of specification error. The specification errors considered are omitted variables, incorrect functional form, simultaneous equation problems and heteroskedasticity.},

 abstract = {Several procedures are proposed for testing the specification of an econometric model in the presence of one or more other models which purport to explain the same phenomenon. These procedures are shown to be closely related, but not identical, to the nonnested hypothesis tests recently proposed by Pesaran and Deaton [7], and to have similar asymptotic properties. They are remarkably simple both conceptually and computationally, and, unlike earlier techniques, they may be used to test against several alternative models simultaneously. Some empirical results are presented which suggest that the ability of the tests to reject false hypotheses is likely to be rather good in practice.},

 abstract = {A simple way of encouraging a nonlinear effect in a regression model to show itself in a partial residual (parres) plot (component-plus-residual plot) is to include a single quadratic term in the regression. It is computationally cheap to do this for each of the independent variables. Examples show that the resulting set of augmented partial residual plots gives insights that are not available from standard parres or added-variable plots.},
